description: The price of faith comes straight out of your own pride.  You must put down a measure of certainty and reason, make an assumption about this world.

If you already claim a faith, don’t be offended by this.  Instead, have the perspective of empty hands, it is a gift.  If you despise the word “faith,” bear with me for a moment.  Regardless of your personal opinion, your worldview began as an assumption.  We have all surrendered a measure of certainty in order to claim what we believe is true.

The word “believe” is defined in the dictionary as: to accept (something) as true, feel sure of the truth of.  The implication is that the truth is unknown at the moment, but it only makes sense that we carry on, we have to try, survive, search for food in this valley or that.  We must make an assumption in order to pursue life.  The future is unknown, but you are more likely to succeed with an attitude of confidence and hope than with fear.  Some may attempt to live without faith, to avoid the folly of ignorant hope; but how can anyone really know which assumptions are foolish.  I urge you to seek the most rewarding life, it is one of beauty.

The implication of surrender does not only apply to faith in religion, but also to faith in our common human practices.  The ideal of social freedom has become greater than our practical desires, it is now a foundation for government.  Our society has taken this human need and we have made it a measure for life.  All it costs is that we surrender our proud impulses to judge and control others who are different from us.  

Many have fought and died for the love of their country.  This faith in service to your nation is rightly honored.  There is a measure of love for others.  Some stand for freedom, but all of our nations are naturally interested in self-preservation.  Should our prosperity be fought for at all costs, is “survival of the fittest” a worthy assumption to live by?  The cost for patriotism is complicated by a favoritism of people.

Business is more than likely a ruthless pursuit, acquiring wealth can be a game, and some people are unashamedly greedy and competitive.  Their actions speak for their faith.  They believe that there is nothing better to do in life than to take what they can.  It is an anti-faith to make a negative assumption such as this.  All they ever amount to is chasing the empty pleasure, and the cost of their faith is in the meaningless drive for more.

Another example is love in marriage.  It is more than attraction, love is a commitment that many intend for life.  In order to marry and stay married, this “love” must transcend our circumstances.  It is a commitment that we believe will make us happy, and one that rewards us with purpose.  This faith lifts up the value of “love,” making it more important than our everyday happiness.  When we surrender ourselves for this commitment we are rewarded with a greater satisfaction in marriage and in life.

In order to embrace these human ambitions we must place them in a sacred position, high above ourselves.  Freedom, goodness, people, country, love, wealth, or self are no longer just practical desires, we give them a value which defines us.  When we choose wisely and place our hope in good beliefs, our lives become rich with meaning.  Faith is its own reward, peace is the reward, freedom is the reward, love is the reward.

A faith in good things is beautiful, and our greatest love is to die for.  I believe this beauty and love is the strongest evidence for any “truth.”  Something so wonderful must be true, it must be worthy of my life.
