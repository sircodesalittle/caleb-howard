description: The price of faith comes straight out of your own pride.  You must put down a measure of certainty and reason, make an assumption about this world.

If you already have faith, don’t be offended by this.  Have the perspective of empty hands, your faith is a gift.  If you have no faith, be challenged to open your hands, release your fists and let go of your pride.

The word “believe” is defined in the dictionary as: to accept (something) as true, feel sure of the truth of.  The implication is that the truth is unknown at the moment.  It only makes sense that we carry on, we have to try, survive, search for food in this valley or that.   The future is unknown, but you are more likely to succeed with an attitude of confidence and hope than with fear.  Some may attempt to live without faith, to avoid the folly of ignorant hope; but I would urge them to seek a more rewarding life.    

We are not only talking about faith in some religion, but also faith in the ideals that we live for, each “belief” comes with a cost.  The ideal of social freedom has become greater than our practical desires, it is now a foundation for government.  Our society has taken this human need and we have made it a measure for life.  All it costs is that we surrender our proud impulses to judge and control others who are different from us.  

Business is ruthless, acquiring wealth is a game, and some people are unashamedly greedy.  Their actions speak for their faith.  They believe that there is nothing better to do in life than to take what they can.  It is an anti-faith to make this negative assumption. All they ever amount to is chasing the empty pleasure.  The cost of their faith is a meaningless drive for more.

Many have fought and died for the love of their country.  This faith in service to our nation is rightly honored.  There is a measure of love here.  America stands for freedom, and that is a better reason than most, but the USA is also a country seeking self-preservation.  Should our prosperity be fought for at all costs, is survival of the fittest a worthy assumption to live by?  The cost for patriotism is complicated with selfishness.

Another example is love in marriage.  It is more than attraction, love is a commitment that many intend for life.  In order to marry and stay married, this “love” must transcend our circumstances.  It is a commitment that we believe will make us happy, and one that rewards us with purpose.  This faith lifts up the value of “love,” making it more important than our everyday happiness.  When we surrender ourselves for this commitment we are rewarded with a greater satisfaction in marriage and in life.

In order to have faith, you must put down a measure of certainty and reason.  In order to embrace these ethereal human ambitions we must place them in a sacred position, high above ourselves.  Freedom, goodness, people, country, love, wealth, or self are no longer practical policies, they are given a value which defines us.  When we choose wisely and place hope in good belief, our lives become rich with meaning.  Hope is it’s own reward, peace is the reward, freedom is the reward, love is the reward.

A faith in goodness is beautiful, and our greatest love is to die for.  I believe this beauty and love is the strongest evidence for any “truth.”  Something so wonderful must be true, it must be worthy of my life.
