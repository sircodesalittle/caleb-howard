description: What are you living for, is there anything worth living for?

The point of this blog is to demonstrate that the most rewarding life is one surrendered in love to something worthy of the sacrifice.  Isnâ€™t that what we are all looking for, the best use of our time, a reason for living?  Every day you wake up with the same plodding existence.  You look for a good job, something you like that makes the most money, you provide for the family, and hope that your interests are fulfilling.  Do you still have dreams for your life?  Dream of one that is worthy.

Consider the human use for faith and love.  When we look closely we find a pattern of self-denial, the act of surrender is rewarded.  How is it that a denial of self leads you to joy?  Your sacrifice of time and energy defines you.  For example, when you dedicate your life to a sport, your time is consumed by practice and the constant drive to be better.  Why are we so pleased when all of our attention is centered on a single goal?  We are both selfless and selfish when we give ourselves to something important.  This surrendering of life is the definition of the greatest love. 

What are you living for: achievement, family, love, freedom, justice, the pursuit of happiness?  Are these nothing more than selfish instincts?  Perhaps some of them transcend our human motives.  Which of these goals are beautiful and give value to our world?  All of us live for our distractions to some degree, but we also have this secret hope, that in the end we find something better, something of true value.

You look up at the stars and experience the awe of grandeur, you feel small and at the same time a deep desire to become a part of that greatness.  Is it useless to encounter this side of ourselves?  Is there nothing to live for that is greater than life?  We must dream more and not less.  The cynic is withdrawn, reducing all around him to nothing, black and white sterility.  Meaningless.  Stop that, enjoy life, let go of your proud enlightenment.  We must live in a wonder-filled world.  Believe in the things that overwhelm your passions, and love will lead you to greater truth.  Be caught up in the storm of mystery.
