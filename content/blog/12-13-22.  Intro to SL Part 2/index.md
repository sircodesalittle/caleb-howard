description: Surrender In Faith. 
The price of faith comes straight out of your own pride.  You must put down a measure of certainty and reason in order to make an assumption about this world.

The truth is that all worldviews begin as an assumption.  We have all surrendered a measure of certainty in order to believe a claim for truth.  If you already have faith, don’t be offended by this.  Instead, have the perspective of empty hands, faith is a gift.  If you despise the word “faith,” bear with me for a moment.  

The word “believe” is defined in the dictionary as: to accept (something) as true, feel sure of the truth of.  The implication is that the truth is unknown at the moment, but it only makes sense that we carry on, we have to try, to survive, to search for food in some direction.  We must make an assumption in order to pursue life, and you are more likely to succeed with an attitude of confidence and hope than with fear.  Some may attempt to live without faith, to avoid the folly of ignorant hope; but how can anyone really know which assumptions are foolish.  I urge you to seek the most rewarding life, it is one of beauty.

This human act of belief does not only apply to faith in religion but also to faith in our common practices.  The ideal of social freedom has become greater than our practical desires, it is now a foundation for our government.  Society has taken this human need and we have placed it in the sacred position above life.  Is this a foolish assumption?

Business is often ruthless, and some people are unashamedly greedy.  Their actions speak for their beliefs.  The only thing that matters is filling their pockets and taking what they can for themselves.  It is more of an anti-faith to make this negative assumption, and the only thing left for them is the endless drive for satisfaction.  There is clearly a right and wrong answer in life.   Addiction is bad, drugs will destroy you, power and greed corrupt, wisdom is real.

Another example is love in marriage.  It is more than attraction, love is a commitment that many intend for life.  In order to marry and stay married, this love must transcend our circumstances.  It is a commitment that we believe will make us happy, and one that rewards us with purpose.  This faith lifts up the value of love, making it more important than our everyday happiness.  When we surrender ourselves to this belief, we are rewarded with a greater satisfaction in marriage.

We all make assumptions for life, and when we embrace these beliefs we also lift them up, high above ourselves.  It is the act of surrender, to yield, to give up, to submit.  We cannot help but commit our lives to our greatest hopes, to live according to the claims we make for truth.  They inevitably define your life.  Freedom, family, love, wealth, or self are no longer just practical, they are extremely valuable.  When we choose wisely and place our hope in good beliefs, our lives become rich with meaning.  Faith is its own reward, peace is the reward, freedom is the reward, love is the reward.

A faith in these good things is beautiful, and our greatest love is to die for.  I believe this beauty and love is the strongest evidence for any “truth.”  Something so wonderful must be true, it must be worthy of my life.
