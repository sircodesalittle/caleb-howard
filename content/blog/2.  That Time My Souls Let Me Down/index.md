Surrender, what a word.  It reminds me of several stories in my youth when I believed that quitting was not an option.  That God would absolutely bless my determination to achieve whatever I set my mind to do.  The mantra “quitters never win, winners never quit” quickly took hold of my life, and it continued all through college until my senior year identity crisis finally flipped the switch.  A better mantra may have been: “If at first you don’t succeed, try really hard at something else.”  There are some of you who have already begun to judge.  Maybe you believe in some psychology of winning.  Let me give you an example where, under the right circumstances, the skin of your feet will peel itself straight back.

One day, more than a decade ago, on a hot summer Sunday in Missouri, I attended a rally of sorts with my fellow salesman.  Our Sunday sermon was not of Jesus, but rather for the purpose of making money on some other “good” books.  Educational reference books, much better than encyclopedias, are sold by young college students every summer across America.  And I was among the lucky few, except on this particular morning, not so lucky.

We met together every Sunday during the 12 week internship to regain the enthusiasm of sales, and on this day the theme was “Momentum.”  After several weeks into the program, it’s expected that you have an understanding of what you are doing.  You ought to be equipped and ready to win big.  So, the excellent example of someone pushing a car in neutral ought to unveil the mystery of success and consistency.  I was chosen it, and for some reason happened to be barefoot on the flat asphalt parking lot.  The car was ready, and the idiot eager to learn his lesson.

All said and done, the car did gather momentum, the crowd will never forget it, and my sales manager performed some miraculous first aid with nothing more than clean water, a whole tube of antibiotic ointment, and duck tape.  Every day for the next week, I neither quit nor won, but soldiered on as the stubborn level headed boy that I was.  Four square inches to stand on.  Too motivated to quit, too sober minded to sell very many books.  How crazy to think that your skin can heal back into position if you can keep it from becoming infected.  All thanks to God, and my buddy Brent.  

Is that story a metaphor for sales?  Is First Aid a life saver?  Did that experience shake off the self doubt I constantly sought to disprove?  No.  I think that the ultimate life lesson is more complicated than success or failure.  You can win everything and still be miserable, you can have nothing and be the happiest man on earth.  We are all living in the same tragic world.  But perhaps, if you are able to redefine success and failure according to the perfect standard, then the confusion disappears.  The right perspective brings contentment and peace.  The greatest life is redefined by something so much more important than your happiness.  It is a life that cannot be lost or broken, it is a perspective of success that will never change.  When you hit the road, your feet aren’t going to cut it, you need shoes.
