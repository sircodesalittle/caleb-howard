description: The only faith that can give true meaning is one that exists outside of our minds.

The problem with any belief is that there is always a logical way to disassemble the pieces.  If faith is like building a tower of assumptions, then the process of tearing it down is skeptical reductionism.  Are you able to defend the assumptions that inform your life, or are they torn apart?   

Beauty itself has an element of faith.  It is difficult to say why something is beautiful, all you have is an emotional response that triggers the belief, “there is beauty!”  Is that all there is to it, a chemical reaction?  You can be sure that it is in the eye of the beholder, but I believe that our experience reaches for an objective beauty that exists outside of our minds.  

The theory of evolution would logically explain that “love” has developed for adaptation and procreation, commitments were established for survival, and cooperation formed as the means of conquest.  The idea of loyalty grew through the generations.  Those who were unable to love, cooperate, or commit to each other were left behind as weaker, maladaptive humans.  Survival by faith and love.  Are these beliefs nothing more than the manipulative devices of nature?

There it’s done, the tower of assumptions has been reduced into uninspired theory.  Faith, beauty, and love are useless words if they only exist within our selfish instincts.  They have been defined as nothing more than the temporary delusions of humanity.

Now let’s say that you ignore this skepticism, because that’s no way to live.  It’s better to indulge yourself with the impulses of the mind.  You care for your family, enjoy life, choose to believe in your work, and appreciate some measure of morality.  You follow your imagination into beauty, engage emotionally in love, and have hope for the future.  Are you really able to live like this, in ignorant bliss?  Are you really able to derive meaning in life as you ignore your worldview of naturalism?

The reality is that a world without true beauty, love, or faith is meaningless.  War or peace, life and death, these are all the same, one way to live or another, there is no right or wrong.  Love, hate, freedom, slavery, family, these are all empty.  It’s all in your head, a game, the temporary pursuit of happiness.  How pointless, to live and die?  How many have dreamt of legacy, and how quickly are they forgotten after their death.  If this universe is all that there is, then compassion and generosity must truly be tricks of evolution, selfish instincts.  They are lies.

The only way to give meaning to these moral principles is to believe that they exist outside of our minds.  There must be a greater truth that illuminates nature, a tower of assumptions suspended from the sky, not subject to criticism, not grown in the cesspool of science.  Love must exist independent of nature, it must have a reality of its own, an existence that defines ours.  

Our assumptions must stretch into a world beyond this world.  All of our hopes and dreams are worthless without a greater reality that gives them value.  Love must exist as a super-natural law to govern a universe of seen and unseen truth.  This supernatural love is untouchable, and worthy of our surrender life.
