description: The Problem With Faith.  The only faith that can give meaning to our lives is one that exists outside of us, an existence that defines ours.
---

The problem with any belief is that there is always a logical way to disassemble the pieces.  If faith is like building a tower of assumptions, then the process of tearing it down is skeptical reductionism.  Instead of the embellished beauty of life, you are left with a tasteless existence.  Why would anyone maintain a faith that does nothing to enrich their lives?  Which beliefs do you ascribe to: humans are basically good, nature is all that there is, perhaps a religion of some variety?  Are you able to defend the assumptions that inform your life?   

Beauty itself has an element of faith.  It is difficult to say why something is beautiful, all you have is an emotional response that triggers the belief, “there is beauty.”  Is this merely a subjective impulse?  You can be sure that it is in the eye of the beholder, but I believe the experience reaches for an objective beauty that exists outside of our minds.  How can beauty exist objectively, isn’t that a contradiction?   

The theory of evolution would logically explain that “love” has developed for adaptation and procreation.  Commitments were established for survival and cooperation formed as the means for one group to establish dominance over others.  The idea of loyalty grew through the generations.  Those who were unable to love, cooperate, or commit to each other were left behind as weaker, maladaptive humans.  Survival by faith and love.  Are these beliefs nothing more than the manipulative devices of nature?

There, it’s done.  The tower of assumptions has been reduced into uninspired theory.  Faith, beauty, and love are useless words if they only exist within our selfish instincts.  The wonder-filled world is lost, because reductionism has defined these ideals as nothing more than the temporary delusions of humanity.

Now let’s say that you ignore the skepticism, because that’s no way to live.  It’s better to indulge yourself with these impulses of the mind.  You care for your family, enjoy life, choose to believe in your work, and appreciate some measure of morality.  You follow your imagination into beauty, engage emotionally in love, and have hope for the future.  Are you really able to live like this, in ignorant bliss?  

When your beliefs are in ruin, the most valued pieces of your life are useless.  War or peace, life and death, these are all the same, one way to live or another.  Meaningless.  Survival or adaptation, there is no right or wrong.  Love, hate, freedom, slavery, family, work, and even a good life, these are all empty.  It’s all in your head, a game, the temporary pursuit of happiness and survival.  How pointless, to live and die?  How many have dreamt of legacy, and how quickly are they forgotten after their death.  If this world is all that there is?  Compassion and generosity must truly be tricks of evolution, selfish instincts, they are lies.

The only way to give meaning to these moral principles is to believe that they exist outside of our minds.  There must be a greater truth that illuminates nature, a tower of faith suspended in the sky, not subject to criticism, not grown in the cesspool of evolution.  Love must exist independent of nature, it must have a reality of its own, an existence that defines ours.

This world must be the signpost that leads us to faith.  Nature is not a collection of facts, but a passionate drama.  Anyone who has ever witnessed the birth of new life, especially a child, ought to be overwhelmed with the delicate miracle that it is.  Life pulls us to believe that there is more to this mystery, something that science will never explain.

Our assumptions must stretch into a world beyond this world, otherwise they are meaningless.  All of our hopes and dreams are worthless without a greater reality that gives them value.  Love must exist as a super-natural law to govern a universe of seen and unseen truth.  This supernatural love is untouchable, and worthy of our surrender life.
