You know the feeling after traveling a long distance from home, you have a realization that things are different.  Maybe the gas station chains are interesting, the grocery stores are another color, the people talk funny and look funny.  Then they start to look funny at you, “You’re not from around here, are you?”  

Especially when you fly, there’s nothing like the experience of landing in another part of the country, and even more so in another part of the world.  You get this anticipation of strangeness.  You might have vacation excitement, or different language anxiety.  Culture shock.  Many years of my childhood were spent crossing this emotional territory, of both anxiety and excitement.  My family spent more than a decade traveling between Moscow, Russia and our country of origin, the southern United States of America.  

There is just an adjustment that needs to happen in your mind as you shift from one culture to another.  You play a different role as a foreigner.  For example, our vacation time in the US of A was spent driving through different states in cars, exploring our friend’s single family homes, and going to suburban grocery stores filled with the standard array of choices.  Options, possibilities, loud American freedom.  In contrast, our daily life experience in Moscow, not unlike other major cities, was filled with strange people, public transit, small apartments, corner stores, street vendors, and the need for some caution and suspicion.  Quiet, focused, act like you’re supposed to be here.  Country versus city, English versus Russian, freedom versus… you name it.

Our family was mostly insulated in an expatriate community of Americans.  The language barrier and our English speaking school kept my interactions with Russians limited.  It is so easy to stay within the confines of your cultural oasis, but I regret the lost opportunities to engage.  Is that challenge really worth the effort?  

During high school, my family moved to Wales for a couple years.  There was no language barrier, just the confusion of the local British vernacular that took some getting used to.  We no longer had an American community to retreat to, but our family did have a church connection.  We were able to make friends quickly and find a community to feel at home in.  

On the other hand, my personal experience in a Welsh high school was much more difficult than in the international school in Russia.  I stood out like a sore thumb, and as soon as I opened my mouth, the obnoxious question was inevitable, “Are you American?”  I was burdened in school, but content with new friends just down the road.  The teenage years are awkward no matter who you are, maybe my frustration at school actually kept me out of trouble.

One of my favorite cultural encounters was meeting some kid who, on hearing my American accent for the first time, immediately asked, “How do you feel that your country is destroying the world?”  There was nothing to say in response to that.  I said something like, “It’s terrible, isn’t it?”  The question was absurd, but to some degree I was truly caught between “America is the greatest country in the world” and “America is destroying the world.”  The most experience those teenagers had of America came from watching the “telle” and from playing the video game, Grand Theft Auto: guns, fat people, drug dealers, police, fast food, gangsters, and Hollywood millionaires.  I have to wonder if their parents had similar opinions.  My English teacher gave the class an essay assignment on “The American Dream.”  My words were either heavily criticized or solid gold.  Sometimes life is a joke.

A foreigner in culture shock has an excellent perspective to reevaluate their definition of life.  We are all affected by the environment around us.  Be wise, consider your own narrow view of the world, be willing to cross uncomfortable boundaries, and don’t forget to smile and nod.
