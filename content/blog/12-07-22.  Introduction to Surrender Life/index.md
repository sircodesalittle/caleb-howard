description: Surrender in Life.  What are you living for, is there anything worth living for?
---

The point of this blog is to demonstrate that the most satisfying life is one surrendered in love to something worthy of the sacrifice.  Isnâ€™t that what we are all looking for, the best use for our time, a reason for living?  You wake up every day to the dreary grind, looking for a good job that makes the most money, one that provides for the family, and fulfills some personal vision.  What is your dream, do you still dream?  Give your life to something worthy.

Consider the human use for faith and love.  When we look closely a pattern of self-denial emerges, and in each of these surrender is rewarded.  The irony is that we receive joy as we experience an ongoing denial of self.   For example, if you dedicate your life to a sport, your time is consumed by practice and a constant drive to be better.  Why are we so pleased when all of our attention and excitement is focused on a single goal?  This is living for the focus.  When we give ourselves to something important, we are selflessly selfish.  This surrendering of life is the definition of love.  All that remains is to find that which is worthy of our time.

What are you living for: competition, family, love, freedom, justice, pursuit of happiness, responsibility for our world?  Are these nothing more than selfish instincts?  Perhaps some of them transcend culture.  Which of these goals are beautiful and give us meaning?  All of us live for distraction to some degree, but in the end we all hope that we have found something better.

Look up at the stars and experience the awe of grandeur, you feel small and at the same time a deep desire to become a part of that greatness.  Is this a useless dream, to encounter this side of ourselves?  Is there nothing to live for that is greater than life?  We must dream more and not less, find the calling.  The life of the cynic is withdrawn, reducing all around him to nothing, black and white sterility.  Stop that, enjoy life, give up your proud enlightenment.  We cannot throw away our hope, we must live in a wonder-filled world.  Believe in things that overwhelm your passions, and love will lead you to greater things.  Be caught up in the storm.
