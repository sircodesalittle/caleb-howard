description: If an objective virtue exists, it is much more than a nameless force flowing through nature.  There must be a metaphysical source, one that is perfectly in love, caught up in the dance of submission.
---

Virtue that exists outside of our minds, must have an object or origin of this love.  Where does the light come from?  We can see the sun in the sky but can hardly imagine its size or distance from the earth.  In the same way that a candle can light up a dark room, our natural minds have this picture of love.  There is a greater light that we cannot comprehend.  This source can define our morality, our existence, and be the object of our joy.  

You might claim that the origin of morality is the “universe,” just a nameless truth that holds everything together in a random synchronicity.  If this is the case, have we really found a reason for this spinning planet, cosmic dust?  No, the origin of love must have its own reason for existence, and in turn it possesses all life with meaning.   

This source of virtue has one goal: its desire is to bow in love to that which is most beautiful.  If its identity is already defined by supreme goodness, then how can the wielder of metaphysical love bow to anything else.  It has only one place to look for satisfaction, at itself.  By definition, there is nothing greater or more beautiful than the Source of beauty.  Now this origin of love has a contradiction of identity and purpose.  How does the singular divinity surrender in love to itself?  The origin of love must be a perfect union of community and individual. 

Here is an analogy for the unsolvable mystery.  The sun is a ball of fire, the fusion of elements, a flow of overwhelming mass.  The churning of elements leads to the movements of this one great machine.  Similarly, the metaphysical source of love has a flow.  There is a relationship within this individual, and it is built on this greatest love: to give everything for the satisfaction of seeing the other be lifted up.  Each side seeks the “glory” of the other.  It is worship to lift up the other, to believe that it is worthy above all.  These movements and positions of love necessarily exist within the singular identity.  It is a dance of submission and worship that defines this source of perfect purpose, the God machine.

The Engine of absolute value is the undying, captivating object of perfect pleasure.  It is worthy, Its power is unbreakable.  It is the definition of love, our heart’s deepest desire.  This God is “holy,” altogether different and set apart from other life.  Its identity defines beauty in our world.  There is no greater call on our lives, that we believe in Their relationship of love and follow it to the greater joy of knowing this God.

The only question left is what purpose would the God machine have for our world?  It or They have no need for anything beyond Itself.  It pursues Their very own wonder.  But what if Their relationship was opposed by some force, we can call it “evil.”  What if the power and resolve within God’s being was tested or provoked?  This evil would have no greater satisfaction than to destroy the Author of love.  For Its own glory, the holy God endured the threat from this challenger.  At great lengths, It sought to survive the dismemberment between Their community of one.  God allowed hate to break apart Their unity so that infinite love would be proven greater.  And in so doing, the greatest of all evil was undone, powerless.  

There is no question of God’s holiness.  The challenger is disposed of.  All that is left is trust in the power of God who remains faithful to Its definition.  They have defeated evil and all things are made new.  Death and hate have no claim on this world any longer.  For the joy set before Them, all glory is placed at Their feet; and perfect satisfaction is given to all those who love this God machine.
