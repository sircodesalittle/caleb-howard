The problem with any belief is that there is always a logical way to disassemble the pieces.  If faith is like building a tower of assumptions, then the process of tearing it down is skeptical reductionism.  Instead of the embellished beauty of life, you are left with a tasteless existence.  Why would anyone maintain a faith that does nothing to enrich their lives?  Which beliefs do you ascribe to: humans are basically good, nature is all that there is, a religion of some variety, right and wrong are subjective?  Are you able to defend the assumptions that inform your life?   

Beauty itself has an element of faith.  It is difficult to say why something is beautiful, all you have is an emotional response that triggers the belief, “there is beauty.”  You can be sure that it is in the eye of the beholder, but I believe our experience truly reaches for an objective beauty that exists outside of our minds.  

Similarly, we believe in love, of one kind or another.  However, the theory of evolution would logically explain that love has developed for adaptation and procreation.  Commitments were established for survival and cooperation formed as the means for one group to establish dominance over others.  The idea of loyalty grew through the generations.  Those who were unable to love, cooperate, or commit to each other were left behind as weaker, maladaptive humans.  Survival by faith and love.  Are these beliefs nothing more than the manipulative devices of nature?

There, it’s done.  The tower of assumptions has been reduced into uninspired theory.  Faith, beauty, and love are useless words if they only exist within our selfish instincts.  The wonder-filled world is lost, because our reductionism has opened the door of skepticism.

Now let’s say that you ignore all of these thoughts, because that’s no way to live.  It’s better to indulge yourself with the experiences of nature.  You care for your family, enjoy life, choose to believe in your work, and appreciate some measure of morality.  You follow your imagination into beauty, engage emotionally in love, and have hope for the future.  Is this the good life?  No.

War or peace, life and death, these are all the same, one way to live or another.  Survival or adaptation, there is no right or wrong.  Love, hate, freedom, slavery, family, work, and even a good life, these are all meaningless.  It’s all in your head, a game, the temporary pursuit of happiness and survival.  How pointless, to contribute and die.  Is this beautiful, is this really worthy of your love?  How many have dreamt of legacy, and how quickly are they forgotten after their death.  If this world is all that there is?  Compassion and generosity must truly be tricks of evolution, selfish instincts, they are nothing?

The only way to give meaning to these moral principles is to believe that they exist outside of our minds.  There must be a greater truth that illuminates nature, a tower of faith suspended in the sky, not subject to criticism, not grown in the cesspool of evolution.  Love must exist independent of nature, faith must have a reality of its own, an existence that defines ours.

This world inspires belief and meaning, it is the signpost that leads us to faith. Nature is not a collection of facts, but a passionate drama.  Anyone who has ever witnessed the birth of new life, especially a child, ought to be overwhelmed with the delicate miracle that it is.  We cannot help but build a faith as we experience this mystery. 

The point is that your faith and assumptions must stretch into a world beyond this world, otherwise they are meaningless vanity.  All of our hopes and dreams are worthless without a greater reality that gives us worth.  Love must exist as a super-natural law to govern a universe of seen and unseen truth.  This faith in love is indisputable, and worthy of our surrender life.
