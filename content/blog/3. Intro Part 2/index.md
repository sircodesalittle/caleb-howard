description: You must put down a measure of certainty and reason in order to make an assumption about this world.

Every worldview begins as an assumption.  We have all surrendered a measure of certainty in order to believe a claim for truth.  The word “believe” is defined in the dictionary as: to accept (something) as true, feel sure of the truth of.  The implication is that the truth is unknown at the moment, but it only makes sense that we carry on, we have to survive.  You are more likely to succeed with an attitude of confidence and hope than with fear.  Some may attempt to live without faith, to avoid the folly of ignorant hope; but how can anyone really know which assumptions are foolish.  I urge you to seek a more rewarding life, it is one of beauty.

This human act of belief does not only apply to faith in religion but also to our common values.  For example, the ideal of freedom has become greater than our practical desires.  Society has taken this human need and we have placed it in the sacred position above life.  Is this a foolish assumption, an ignorant hope?

Faith in achievement is also an assumption for life.  Business is often ruthless, and some are unashamedly greedy.  Their actions speak for their beliefs.  Perhaps they mistakenly treasure their ability to take instead of the pleasure it is to provide for others.  If you make a negative assumption that there is nothing better to live for than yourself, then this becomes more of an anti-faith worldview.    

Another example of faith is love in marriage.  This “love” is a commitment, and in order to stay married it must transcend our circumstances.  We must lift up the value of love, making it more important than ourselves.  If we surrender to this belief, we are rewarded with a greater satisfaction in marriage.  The assumption and commitment of love defines and empowers the relationship.

We all make assumptions for life, and when we embrace a belief we will inevitably surrender, yield, submit to it.  We cannot help but commit our lives to our greatest hopes, to live according to the claims we make for truth.  They define our lives as we follow them.  Freedom, love, wealth, or family, these are the monumental beliefs that shape us.  If we choose wisely and place our hope in good assumptions, our lives become rich with meaning.  Faith is its own reward, freedom is the reward, love is the reward.  

A faith in these is life changing, and our greatest love is to die for.  The joy we feel for these treasures is our strongest evidence for any “truth,” something so wonderful must be true, it must be worthy of my life.
